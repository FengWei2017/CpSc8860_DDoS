ECE 8930 Lab-03 Scripts Execution Instructions


This document contains example codes for ECE 8930 assignment 3. Before proceeding the please re-run the ‘sudo bash omg_localdnf.sh’ where this script is located in your VM. Requirement is to use your Linux Fedora virtual machine for this lab. Login to your VM and run the following commands : 
A) SFTP into NAS with the command sftp <username>@192.168.10.5 (Charleston students should use 192.168.20.5).
    Navigate to ECE8930/ECE8930_lab3_spring_2018 on sftp and download the following files A.1) ‘bittwist-linux-2.0.tar.gz’ using get ‘bittwist-linux-2.0.tar.gz’ command.

B)  Navigate to the same NAS folder and download the file ‘ECE8930_lab3_spring_2018_scripts.tgz’ using ‘get ECE8930_lab3_spring_2018_scripts.tgz’ command. Unzip the file using tar -xvzf ECE8930_lab3_spring_2018_scripts.tgz. It should have the following files : 
         rand_arr_time.py
         read_pcap.py
scapy_example.py
time_series.py
bittwist.sh
setup_bittwist.sh
sample2.pcap
README
From this point on, refer to this point in the file README. It is replica of this file.

C) Copy the file setup_bittwist.sh to the folder bittwist-linux-2.0. Execute following scripts with sudo : a) python_setup.sh


D) Run the setup_bittwist.sh file with sudo bash setup_bittwist.sh command in your virtual machine. This should install bittwist for you. Contact your TA/Lab-guide in case of errors or issues in script installation. If you see one single warning, it is expected and compiler specific, please ignore it.

     E) The example.py script will help you generate a time series plot of the pcap captured packets. In order to execute the example.py script on host machine (same script from Lab 01) , perform following steps : 
Copy the pcap file to the NAS via sftp using put command in sftp shell. 
In the host machine, fetch it from NAS using get command. Run python3 example.py <pcap-filename>.pcap
 
 


There are three examples:
1 Plot time series (example.py). This script should be present in the home folder of your host machine in pcap_utl directory from LAB 01. 
2 Modify packets with scapy (scapy_example.py). In case this script fails, it is probably because you need to correct the interface on line 27 to the one you are using. The default hard-coded interface is ‘enp2s0’.You will know the correct interface by checking for the appropriate interface on wireshark.
3 Replay pcap file with Bittwist (bittwist_example.sh)

read_pcap.py is imported by plot_time_series_example.py to read pcap/pcapng files.
time_series.py is imported by plot_time_series_example.py to plot time series.

A pcap and/or pcapng file is required for some of the examples.
tshark, matplotlib, and numpy are required packages for some of the example codes.
Each example code contains multiple example functions. Check each file for detailed explanation and usage examples. Feel free to modify.


Quick start:
python3 example.py <filename>.pcap : To be executed on host machine
python plot_time_series_example.py : To be executed in the linux virtual machine.
sudo bash bittwist_example.sh : To be executed in the linux virtual machine. It needs one or more pcap files as arguments.
